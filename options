Option 1: Granular Control with Azure Automation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview)
This approach offers more flexibility and customization but requires some scripting knowledge. Here's the workflow:
1.	Azure Automation: Establish an Azure Automation account to run scripts or pre-built runbooks for patching Windows and Linux VMs.
	Alternative Script Execution (Optional): consider Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions. 
2.	Azure Policy: Define policies to enforce patching compliance and ensure VMs meet our organization's security standards.
3.	Azure DevOps (Optional): Integrate Azure DevOps pipelines to trigger VM deployment from AMIs or snapshots after patching is complete.
   Sample workflow: 
1.	When a new VM is provisioned, an event triggers an Azure Automation runbook.
2.	The runbook checks the OS type (Windows or Linux) of the VM.
3.	For Windows VMs, the runbook executes a PowerShell script to install Windows updates.
4.	For Linux VMs, the runbook executes a shell script to update packages using the appropriate package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS).
5.	After patching is complete, the runbook marks the VM as compliant using Azure Policy.

Benefits of Option 1:
•	Granular control over the patching process
•	Customization to fit specific needs.
Considerations:
•	Requires personnel with good automation skills, including Azure DevOps knowledge.
Option 2: Straightforward Approach with Automatic VM Guest Patching (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching)
This built-in Azure service offers a simpler solution:
•	Automatic VM Guest Patching: Leverages Azure to automatically download and install security updates for supported Windows and Linux VMs.
Benefits of Option 2:
•	Easier to implement and manage.
•	Faster to set up, allowing for a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to demonstrate immediate results.
Recommendation:
Starting with Automatic VM Guest Patching (Option 2) provides a quick win and strengthens security. As the team gains experience with Azure automation, we can transition to Option 1 for more granular control in the future.
Next Steps:
•	Let's discuss the best approach based on our team's comfort level and automation experience.
•	We can proceed with a POC for Automatic VM Guest Patching to showcase its effectiveness.

Please note, pathing is ongoing activity so usage of Azure Bicep or any IaC is not so beneficial, IaC is useful for repetitive options like creating cloud resources etc.
